# Rprolixus_metabolites
This repository describes the analysis of compounds found in the guts of *Rhodnius prolixus*. Insects were either exposed to blood containing *Trypanosoma cruzi* parasites, or not. The insects were dissected, compounds extracted and then analyzed by mass spectrometry.

Here we take the raw data, clean and process it, engineer new features based on chemical structure, and then analyze the dataset with different machine learning models to predict whether an insect was exposed to parasite or not. We subsequently analyze the features that shape the predictions in each model and attempt to determine what that compound is.

In nature, these insects are one of many species that can transmit the parasite that causes Chagas disease. Ultimately, we aim to be able to sample insects in the environment and determine if they have been exposed to the parasite, allowing for rapid intervention to prevent the spread of disease.
